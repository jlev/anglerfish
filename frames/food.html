The angler lies very still, extends the "bait" and waits for an unsuspecting fish to pass by. When a fish comes close looking for a meal, the angler retracts the bait and simultaneously starts sucking water into its body. The fish is sucked into the anglers mouth and is torn to shreds by the anglers formidable teeth. Some deep-sea anglers also have a light emmiting organ on the bait. Anglers jaws are not hinged so they can eat fish as large as themselves.</body></html>
