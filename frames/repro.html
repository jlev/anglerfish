The male is very small at 5 centimeters, whereas the females can be as large as 40 centimeters. He swims around until he finds a female, he attaches himself with his teeth and gets his nutrients directly from the females blood stream. He eventually becomes part of the female, as an external sperm-producing gland. Some females have more than five attached males.</body></html>
